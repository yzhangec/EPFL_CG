We are using a couple of C++11 features, so please ensure that you use an up-\/to-\/date compiler (G\+CC 4.\+7 or higher, Visual Studio 2012). \href{www.cmake.org}{\tt C\+Make} is used for setting up build environments.

\subsection*{Building under Linux/mac\+OS }

Inside the exercise\textquotesingle{}s top-\/level directory, execute the following commands\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
\end{DoxyVerb}


The last command -- i.\+e. {\ttfamily make} -- compiles the application. Rerun it whenever you have added/changed code in order to recompile.

To build a pretty documentation use\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}make doc
\end{DoxyVerb}


and open the {\ttfamily index.\+html} in the html folder with your favourite browser. To build the documentation, you must install Doxygen.

\subsection*{Building with X\+Code (mac\+OS) }

If you wish, you can use the C\+Make build system to generate an X\+Code project. Inside the exercise\textquotesingle{}s top-\/level directory, execute the following commands\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}mkdir xcode
cd xcode
cmake -G Xcode ..
open RayTracing.xcodeproj
\end{DoxyVerb}


\subsection*{Building under Microsoft Windows (Visual Studio) }


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Start the C\+Make-\/\+G\+UI.
\item Open the Ray\+Tracing top-\/level directory as source directory.
\item Choose a build directory.
\item Click on configure and select Visual Studio as generator.
\item Click generate to create the Visual Studio project files.
\item Open the Visual Studio solution file that is in the build directory you chose in C\+Make.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Running the \hyperlink{classRay}{Ray} Tracer }

The program expects two command line arguments\+: an input scene ({\ttfamily $\ast$.sce}) and an output image ({\ttfamily $\ast$.tga}). To render the scene with the three spheres, while inside the {\ttfamily build} directory, type\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}./raytrace ../scenes/spheres/spheres.sce output.tga
\end{DoxyVerb}


If you have finished all exercise tasks, use \begin{DoxyVerb}./raytrace 0
\end{DoxyVerb}


to render all scenes at once.

To set the command line parameters in M\+S\+VC or Xcode, please refer to the documentation of these programs (or use the command line...).

\subsection*{Assignment 1\+: Planes and Cylinders }

In this assignment, you will implement ray intersections with planes and cylinders and compute surface normals at the intersection points. The framework code provided this week is identical to last week\textquotesingle{}s, except {\ttfamily todo} comments have been inserted in {\ttfamily \hyperlink{Plane_8cpp}{Plane.\+cpp}} and `\+Cylinder to indicate where you need to add your implementations.

If you already set up a Git\+Hub repository last week to collaborate with your fellow group members, you can copy these T\+O\+DO comments over to your repository (or just note where your implementation needs to go and get started).

Please see the assignment handout P\+DF for more information and submission instructions. Note\+: there is a theory exercise for this assignment!
